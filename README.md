# PyQt5 BlackJack

## Starting ðŸš€
This project is a simple implementation of the blackjack game.
It has been developed in Python3 using the PyQt5 library.

If you don't know how this game works, you should [consult this reference](https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/blackjack/#:~:text=When%20the%20dealer%20has%20served,dot%20the%20dealer%20must%20stand.).

### Prerequisites ðŸ“‹
You will need to have Python3 installed on your device as well as PyQt5.
I recommend that you install the same version of PyQt5 that I used, using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
I strongly recommend you using your own (virtual environment)[https://towardsdatascience.com/virtual-environments-104c62d48c54#:~:text=A%20virtual%20environment%20is%20a,a%20system%2Dwide%20Python.].
